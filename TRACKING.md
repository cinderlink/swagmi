## Security Vulnerabilities Found

1. **Svelte 3.59.2**: XSS vulnerability (requires v4.2.19+)
2. **SvelteKit 1.30.4**: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities (requires v2.8.3+)
3. **esbuild**: Security issue in dev server (via vite/wagmi-cli)

## Linting Issues ✅ FIXED

All 27 linting errors have been resolved:

- Removed unused imports from components
- Replaced TypeScript `any` types with proper types (ContractInterface, unknown[], etc.)
- Added eslint-disable comments for valid inner function declarations

- Updated prettier config to remove deprecated --plugin-search-dir option

## Notes

- Using pnpm as package manager
- Library is published to npm as "swagmi"
- Depends on @cinderlink/ui-kit for UI components
- Need to maintain backward compatibility where possible
